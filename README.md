# DDB

This is a collection of diamond buffers implemented with discrete components. DDB thus stands for "Discrete Diamond Buffer".

## Discrete Diamond Buffers

Diamond buffers are an output stage topology consisting of four transistors at its core. 
Two transistors form a traditional complementary push-pull emitter-follower/common-collector output stage. 
The other two transistors are configured as a complementary, folded, emitter-follower/common-collector driver stage.
